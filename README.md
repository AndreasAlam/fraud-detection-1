# Fraud Detection

## Introduction

This school project was completed by 5 students of the join degree Data Science for Business, between Ecole polytechnique and HEC Paris.
It was done for a course titled "Born2Code", in partnership with [Quinten](https://www.quinten-france.com/) (Data Science Consulting firm). 

Fraud detection is an increasing center of focus since machine learning democratization. It has applications in various fields such as:
ecommerce, platform, social networks, insurances or banks. The implied costs are always consequent and the
patterns difficult to detect, even harder to automatically detectâ€¦

One of the main challenges in this specific problematic is to deal with highly imbalanced
datasets: imagine the number of credit card transaction per day, the large part of them is obviously not
fraudulent, which infringes us to reach a balanced dataset, as in other ML problematics. This case study is
centered on existing methods to tackle this problem.

## I. Business approach of the problem

## II. Read the data

## III. Our data science approach

## Conclusion

## Bonus: Kedro

### A. Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.15.1` by running:

```
kedro new
```

Take a look at the [documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

### B. Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:
 * Please don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file provided
 * Make sure your results can be reproduced by adding necessary data to `data/01_raw` only
 * Don't commit any data to your repository
 * Don't commit any credentials or local configuration to your repository
 * Keep all credentials or local configuration in `conf/local/`

### C. Installing dependencies

Dependencies have been be declared in `src/requirements.txt` for pip installation

To install them, run:

```
kedro install
```

### D. Running Kedro

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```


### E. Working with Kedro from notebooks

In order to use notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

For using Jupyter Lab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

You can also start Jupyter Lab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```
